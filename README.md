README

We all love to listen to music while working. Just after a very tiring day, good music lifts up the mood. We wanted to build something where a system could recognise the user’s mood by their facial expressions and then songs could be played according to the user’s mood detected.

## Structure

- The ```frontend/``` folder contains the frontend for our desktop app
- The ```backend/``` folder contains the backend and heavy working for our app.
